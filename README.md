# Arduino Flappy Bird
This flappy bird game was made to be played using my <a href="https://github.com/leviaviv28/Arduino-Console-Firmware">Arduino game console I am developing.</a> To communicate with the console it also uses <a href="https://github.com/leviaviv28/Arduino-Console-Interface"> this library</a> that I am currently developing.
